Tools and Frameworks Used

I'm using React because it's the framework I've been using the most lately. It's quick to start, it has fast loading times and it's what I feel most confident using nowadays. I'm open to learning other technologies though!

To also accelerate development and not spend too much time on HTML/CSS stuff I'm using Material-UI. It's great because Material Design is from Google, which means that basically everyone would recognize its UX and UI, making it easy to use. Not to mention it takes into account things like accessibility and validation.

I'm also using webpack to serve and build the project.
